By default, I'm using 115200Hz on the terminal.
If the Go Board is reading at 921600 (or 8x faster) then at most the first bit
of the 1x message is misinterpreted as the last bit of an 8x message. Since MSb
comes last, the LSb becomes the MSb and all other bits are zeroed bc of the start bit.
Thus all messages consist of 0x80 or 0x00.

Prediction: If the Go Board is 4x faster, the 2 LSb will become the two MSb.
Messages should consist of 0x00, 0x40, 0x80, 0xC0.
Actual results: 0x00, 0x80, 0x78, 0xF8

Prediction: If the Go Board is 2x faster, each pair of bits will act like one.
Actual results: I have no idea what the pattern is if any.

Prediction: If the Go Board is 16x faster, all it reads is zeros.
Actual result: TRUE.

Prediction: If the Go Board is 16x slower, all it reads is ones.
Actual result: TRUE.

Prediction: If we read 0x00 or 0xFF, we should only see 2 voltage shifts.

Prediction: For any presumed bitrate, we should never see more than 1 voltage shift
per bit period.

Prediction: We should never see a low signal that lasts longer than 9 bit periods,
assuming a stop bit exists.
